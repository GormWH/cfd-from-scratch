# CFD from Scratch

This Project is my challenge to create a CFD program from scratch.

## Why I started this project

I studied fluid mechanics during my undergraduates and masters course.
Using CFD in both course's thesis, I never fully understood how it works.
Lack of understanding in the tools I use, resulting bad quality paper.
With regret, I graduated. Working in a completly different major, a Developer.

As time passed(six months maybe?), I could not resist coming back to CFD because of the feeling that I left my study uncomplete.
So, here I am, trying to study fluid mechanics and CFD again, to finish what I have left undone.
I will start from the very beginning, from the fundamental of fluid mechanics and concepts like timeÂ·space discretization.

## Objectives

* Explain basic concepts and write governing equations like writing a paper
* Construct a CFD program from scratch(try not to use CFD libraries)
* (optional) If possible, I wish my own works could help others study

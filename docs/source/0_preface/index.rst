Preface
============

I studied mechanical engineering at the Osaka University and at the University of Tokyo.
I have used CFD for my graduate research, but never made a CFD program of my own.
Of course, if the focus is on utilizing CFD, I think making a CFD program is not necessary, rather it is better to use a well-tested one.

However,
I think making a CFD program is a good exercise to understand the CFD,
because making one requires a different level of understanding than just using one.

Just because I used CFD for my research, it does not mean that I have a good understanding of CFD.
I lack a lot of knowledge in "Fluid Mechanics", "Numerical Analysis", "Programming" and even "English".
Still, I whish I could help beginners to understand CFD by sharing my knowledge and experience.

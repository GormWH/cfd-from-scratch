What is Fluid Mechanics?
==========================

Fluid mechanics is the study of fluids at rest or in motion :cite:`Fox_2016`.
Fluid mechanics can be applied to a wide variety of fields.
Aerodynamics of airplanes, hydrodynamics of ships, and the hemodynamics of blood flow are all examples of fluid mechanics.
Fluid mechanics could be applied to almost any field that involves a fluid.
Then, what is a fluid?

Definition of a Fluid
=========================

If you look up the word "fluid" in a dictionary, you will find the following definitions:

* a subtance that flows and is not solid (from Cambridge Dictionary)
* a liquid; a substance that can flow (from Oxford Dictionary)

These definitions are not very helpful from a scientific point of view.
A fluid is a substance that deforms continuously under the application of a shear stress.

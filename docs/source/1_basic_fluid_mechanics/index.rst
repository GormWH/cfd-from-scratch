Basic Fluid Mechanics
========================

To mimic the real fluid behavior, we need to understand the basic physics of the real world.
And fluid mechanics is the study of fluid behavior.
In this chapter, the basics of fluid mechanics will be introduced.

From the definition of fluid, we will learn what fluid is.
Then, we will learn the basic properties of fluid, such as density, viscosity, and pressure.
Finally, we will learn the basic equations of fluid mechanics, such as the continuity equation, the Navier-Stokes equation, and the energy equation

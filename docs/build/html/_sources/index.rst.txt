Making CFD Program from Scratch
============================================

This is a tutorial on how to make a CFD program from scratch.
I present the steps in the order I would do them if I were to start from scratch.

.. note::
   I am nither a native English speaker nor an expert in CFD.
   I am a learner, just like most of beginners.
   I am writing this tutorial to help myself understand CFD better, and to help others who are in the same situation as I am.
   I will try to make this tutorial "easy to understand" and as "accurate" as possible,
   but there's no guarantee that this tutorial is 100% correct.
   So if you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know. 

First, I will start from the basics of Fluid Mechanics.
The very first step is to understand the concept of fluid.
After that, the mass and momentum conservation law will derive Navier-Stokes equation.
Then, I will explain how to discretize the Navier-Stokes equation.

Second, I will introduce various numerical methods for solving the discretized equations.

demonstrate how to implement the equations as a computer program.
The implementation can be divided into two parts:

Third,
